# React + TypeScript + Vite

To run the project:

```bash
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

I used https://gitmoji.dev/ to improve commit messages.
You can check it out to understand the meaning of the emojis.

Missing points:

- I would add a loading state to the posts page.
- I would add a better error handling to the posts page.
- I would add a better visual feedback to the posts page.

Both feedbacks could be done with a toast notification.
